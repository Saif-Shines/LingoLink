# LingoLink

## Description

This project is a web application that leverages the power of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The primary function of the app is to translate user input into English, French, and Spanish.

The application utilizes GPT 3.5 Turbo, making calls to Language Models (LLMs) over Portkey. This ensures efficient and accurate translations. Additionally, the project uses Vite to substitute environment variables and to avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues by using the Vite server proxy.

## Usage

To use the application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` or `bun install`
3. Start the Vite server by running `npm run dev` or `bun dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` .
5. Enter your text in the input field and select the language you want to translate to.
6. Click the 'Translate' button to get your translation.
